      <h2>Liquid Inequality</h2>
      <p>
        Navajo nation grapples with a persistent water crisis, marked by widespread contamination and inadequate infrastructure. Decades of environmental degradation, coupled with systemic neglect and underinvestment, have left many communities without access to safe and reliable drinking water. This crisis disproportionately impacts Navajo families, jeopardizing their health, cultural integrity, and economic stability. Urgent action is needed to address this multifaceted challenge and ensure equitable access to clean water for all Navajo people.
        
        The Navajo Nation water crisis stems from decades of inadequate infrastructure, environmental contamination, and limited access to clean water. Many residents lack running water in their homes, relying instead on hauling water from distant sources or relying on contaminated wells. This situation is compounded by the presence of abandoned uranium mines, which have polluted water sources with radioactive materials. The crisis underscores broader issues of environmental injustice and the ongoing neglect of indigenous communities' basic rights to clean water and sanitation.
